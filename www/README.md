# Weather34 skin for WeeWX
Weather Station website skin with Live Data for WeeWX. This version is compatible with WeeWX 3.9.2 / Python 2.7 and WeeWX 4.0.0 builds / Python 2.7 and Python 3.7.

Version WX-HC20-IHVN-1.0.0

Packaged for installation using its own unique installer.

This repository contains the WeeWX version of Brian Underdown's Weather34 website template set. Brian's main website is https://weather34.com/homeweatherstation/index.html In January, 2019, Brian asked others to take over the distribution/maintainence of his design whilst he concentrated on development only for MB NanoSD, called Weather34 MB-SMART. 

This version requires WeeWX version 3.9.2 or later software. WeeWX is available at http://weewx.com

This version is designed explicitly to harness the powerful WeeWX database to generate the weather data charts and statistical data. It is built on the current MB-UB40-IHVN which is now maintained by Lightmaster (Meteobridge-Weather34-Template). A key metric for this project is to maintain design, functional and performance parity with the MB-UB40 parent. 

This version is assembled as an install package and uses the WeeWX utility wee_extension to install. This greatly simplifies the installation process from that of previous versions. Depending on your own WeeWX setup, minor edits may be required to be made to weewx.conf and Weather34 skin.conf files. Please see the Weather34 skin Installation Guide for detailed instructions.

# What's New in this Version WX-HC20-IHVN-1.0.0

1. Change to Highcharts from CanvasJS. The change to Highcharts brings powerful new features to the charts including faster rendering, click-through to different time frames, real time updating, wind rose and much more.

2. New faster install process using its own custom built installer.

# Credits for this version

Apart from Brian Underdown without him, this template would never exist, I would aslo like to acknowledge the following people: -

Jerry Dietrich for his massive contribution in converting my wild ideas into reality, putting me straight on my mediocre coding skills and having the patience of a dozen saints.

Gary Roderick for his original coding of Highcharts for WeeWX.

William Bailey aka Lightmaster who maitains the MB version of Weather34. Incredibly helpful and always on the end of Telegram when I need a chat, night or day.

Ken True for sharing files and who makes my job of maintaining the WeeWX version so much easier.

Thomas Sosio for his invaluable contribution in producing the Meteobridge lookup code to translate WeeWX database output.

David Marshall for contributing technical knowledge and solutions to create some original .tmpl files and alternative solutions for weather alerts.

Taylormia for contributing his excellent setup example for instances where WeeWX and server/template are remote to each other.

Gary Portellas for a helpful suggestion to further simplify the installation process.

Drealine for his recent work on extending the French translations.

All those unamed people who have helped me with testing updates.

The creators of WeeWX without which there would be no point.
